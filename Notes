														Dockers

Docker is a basic tool, like (git VCS) for app's operating system. It uses btrfs (a copy-on-write filesystem) to keep track of filesystem. has a central repository of disk images (upload and download images) that allow you to easily run different operating systems.
The whole idea of Docker is for developers to easily develop applications, ship them into containers which can then be deployed anywhere.
In the case of Linux and non-Hyper-V containers, the Host OS shares its kernel with running Docker containers. For Hyper-V each container has its own Hyper-V kernel
Docker images can be pushed to a repository and can be pulled down to any other host to run containers from that image.
when we want to distribute/collaborate on your app's operating system with a team We use it 
Docker is basically a container engine which uses the Linux Kernel features like namespaces and control groups to create containers on top of an operating system and automates application deployment on the container 
Docker has an workflow for moving application from developers laptop, test environment to production

Dockers have docker containers, images, registries, docker client.
image is a file used to execute code in a Docker container. An image is built from the instructions
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
														  docker vs  Virtual Machine

Docker is container based technology, Virtual Machine on the other hand, is not!
In Docker, the containers share the host OS kernel, VM environment shares hardware resource from the host.
With a container environment, multiple workloads can run with single OS.In Virtual Machine environment, each workload needs a complete OS.

							Behavior Driven Development(simply BDD)

Behavior Driven Development(simply BDD) is a customer-focused process. 
It is based on the understanding of the system or module behavior but in the terms of business/client.
In BDD, we share our expected behaviors across all members of the team.
understand these needs from the start and testing external business behaviors 
that the entire team cares about—that is a great way to ensure a quality project.

						    GIT COMMANDS
								create a new repository on the command line
git init
git add README.md
git commit -m "first commit" -> commenting
git remote add origin https://github.com/avinashseven/ide.git -> URL
git push -u origin master

	 					push an existing repository from the command line
git remote add origin https://github.com/avinashseven/ide.git -> URL
git push -u origin master

							Differenciation in two repo's ->
git remote add -f b path/to/repo_b.git
git remote update
git diff master remotes/b/master
git remote rm b

													Applets
Applet is a Java program that can be embedded into a web page. It runs inside the web browser and works at client side. Applet is embedded into a HTML page by using the APPLET or OBJECT tag and hosted on a web server.
"Applets are used to make the web site more dynamic and entertaining"
When an applet begins, the methods are called, in this sequence:
1. init( )
2. start( )
3. paint( )
destroy()(remove completely from memory, only after free up any resources attached to the applet)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
											Servlet(pacckage ->javax.servlet)

Java Servlet is a "way to create dynamic web pages".
Small program which handles complex requests from a web or application server.
once started, it stays in memory and used for multiple requests.
CYCLE->
Clients send the request to the web server -> Web server receives the request -> Web server passes the request to the corresponding servlet -> servlet processes the request and generate the response(output) -> servlet send the response back to the web server -> Web server sends the response back to the client and he can see it on screen.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
										 JSP

Java Server Page (JSP) is a server-side technology(extension to the Java servlet)
separates the logic from the actual design and display of the webpage.
JSP is translated into Java servlet before running, and processing HTTP requests to generate response like servlets.
JSPs are fully interoperable with servlets. You can include output from a servlet or forward the output to a servlet, and a servlet can include output from a JSP or forward output to a JSP.
==========================================================================================================================
		 							Request Dispatcher
									
Request Dispatcher is an interface defines an object which can dispatch the request to any resources on the server(it may be html, servlet or jsp).
Two Types -> forward method(response from another servlet)
-----------> Include method(response from same servlet but it uses the response of another connected servlet)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

CLIENT is an application that runs on a personal computer or workstation which depends on a server for 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
									HTML(HyperText Markup Language)

HTML is used to create documents on the World Wide Web.
It defines the structure and layout of a Web document by using variety of tags and attributes
There are hundreds of tags used to format and layout the information on a Web page.
major changes in HTML5 is the addressing Web applications, functions for embedding graphics, audio, video, and interactive documents.
 new tags like < article >, <nav>, <source>, 
 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
												Staging

A staging(pre-production) environment is a nearly exact replica of a production environment for software testing. 
Staging environments are made to test codes, builds, and updates to ensure quality under a production-like environment before application deployment
Smoke tests check for service functionalities
User acceptance testing (UAT) are performed from the end user point of view.
